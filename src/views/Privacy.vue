<p>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In Short: We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>

<p>Send users information about special offers and discounts on our products and services</p>
<p>Understand how our users use our products and services so we can improve user experience</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>

<p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>6. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In Short: If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than   the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>9. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at privacy@italianrugbypodcast.com.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>10. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In Short: In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), and Switzerland, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Switzerland), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your Member State data protection authority or UK data protection authority.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Opting out of marketing and promotional communications: You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send, or by contacting us using the details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below. You will then be removed from the marketing lists. However, we may still communicate with you — for example, to send you service-related messages that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Account Information</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:</p>
<p>Contact us using the contact information provided.</p>
<p>Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Cookies and similar technologies: Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Services.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at privacy@italianrugbypodcast.com.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>12. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In Short: Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Revised" date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.</p>
<p></p>
